Hack Day Q4 2016

I worked with Roman on this hack day project to re-do the Placelocal.com home page. 
I coded a page to reflect what Roman designed. The page I coded doesn't include the PL script to actually log in,
or throw errors when invalid user/passwords are entered, and doesn't change the logo based on a subdomain's specified
branding.
